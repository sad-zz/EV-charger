If you’ve recently purchased or leased an electric vehicle, you may have discovered that the “refueling” process is different from gas-powered cars. While gasoline pumps are standardized, EV charging connector adapters vary between automakers.

The variety of connector types can make charging away from home tricky if stations don’t support your car’s plug. But a handy solution has emerged – charging adapters. These devices convert between different connector styles, allowing your EV to “communicate” with and charge from different types of charging equipment. Adapters provide added flexibility so you can charge up no matter what plug the station uses. As long as there is an adapter for your car’s connector type, you’re good to go! This interoperability makes life easier for EV drivers.

In this guide, we’ll look at the major electric vehicle chargers and the adapter options that allow you to use different charging stations.

EV Charging Adapter Types
Manufacturers have introduced several common adapter types to overcome incompatibility between electric vehicle connectors and charging station plugs. Understanding the different adapter solutions available allows EV drivers to confidently explore a much wider public charging infrastructure network. Below we’ll explore some of the most popular adapter options on the market today. Knowing about these key adapter types will allow you to charge your EV seamlessly at more kinds of stations.

J1772 Connector
It serves as both Level 1 and Level 2 equipment, charging through either 120V or 240V/208V outlets. 

Level 1 uses 120V power to provide approximately 5 miles of range/hour of charging. Faster Level 2 charging actively adds around 25 miles of range per hour by accessing higher 240V/208V voltages.

In North America, most electric vehicles have the J1772 connector as standard. This allows them to use most public charging points since J1772 is the dominant standard.

Tesla Connector
Tesla uses a proprietary connector that enables fast Level 2 and ultra-fast DC charging at Tesla Supercharger stations. This allows Tesla EVs to charge quickly, making their stations very appealing. However, since the Tesla plug isn’t universally compatible, Tesla drivers should carry an adapter to ensure they can charge at any public station without risk of stranding due to incompatible plugs.

CCS Connector
The Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors are designed for DC fast charging. As the name suggests, CCS sites can add up to 200 miles in just 30 minutes of charging time – perfect for rapid refueling on road trips. 

However, CCS hasn’t reached full deployment yet. Carrying a CCS to J1772 adapter allows access to emerging CCS fast charging stations. A CCS to Tesla adapter also lets Tesla drivers tap into expanding fast charging networks beyond Tesla’s exclusive sites.

Lectron manufactures well-engineered CCS adapters, especially for Teslas. Their durable design supports fast recharging from third-party DC sites, enhancing long-distance electric driving feasibility. 

NEMA Standards for EV Charging
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association decides the power outlet standards that enable EV charging in the United States. Early EVs used NEMA 5-15 and 5-20 outlets. But NEMA has expanded standards to support faster EV charging needs.

There are now three primary NEMA outlets for EV charging:

NEMA 5-15 – 15 amp, 125-volt outlet powers smaller home appliances.
NEMA 5-20 – 20 amp, 125-volt outlet found in homes and offices for larger equipment.
NEMA 14-50 – 50 amp, 240-volt outlet for RVs, EVs, and major appliances needing serious power.
